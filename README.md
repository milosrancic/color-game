This is Color Game from Colt Steele's "Web Developer Bootcamp" on Udemy.

I've added:
- Insane mode;
- After the correct square is guessed, there is now a message for user that says how many guesses it took;
- Disabled squares being clickable after the correct square has been guessed.


How to play:

A color's RGB value indicates its red, green, and blue intensity. Each intensity value is on a scale of 0 to 255.

Your task is to guess the correct square based on those RGB values. 

There are three modes: Easy (3 squares), Hard (6 squares) and Insane (9 squares).

Good luck :)
