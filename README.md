HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

**I've added:** <br>
- Insane mode;
- After the correct square is guessed, there is now a message for user that says how many guesses it took;
- Disabled squares being clickable after the correct square has been guessed.

*This is Color Game from Colt Steele's "Web Developer Bootcamp" on Udemy.*

**How to play:**<br>
A color's RGB value indicates its red, green, and blue intensity. <br> Each intensity value is on a scale of 0 to 255.<br> Your task is to guess the correct square based on those RGB values. <br>There are three modes: Easy (3 squares), Hard (6 squares) and Insane (9 squares).

Good luck :)
